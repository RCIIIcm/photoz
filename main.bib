	abstract = {We present a novel approach to studying the diversity of galaxies. It is based on a novel spectral graph technique, that of locally-biased semi-supervised eigenvectors . Our method introduces new coordinates that summarize an entire spectrum, similar to but going well beyond the widely used Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Unlike PCA, however, this technique does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a good global measure of similarity. Instead, we relax that condition to only the most similar spectra, and we show that doing so yields more reliable results for many astronomical questions of interest. The global variant of our approach can identify very finely numerous astronomical phenomena of interest. The locally-biased variants of our basic approach enable us to explore subtle trends around a set of chosen objects. The power of the method is demonstrated in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample, by illustrating that the derived spectral coordinates carry an unprecedented amount of information.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06607},
	abstract = {We developed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), used as a classifier, to estimate photometric redshifts and associated probability distribution functions (PDF) for galaxies in the Main Galaxy Sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z {\textless} 0.4. Our method exploits all the information present in the images without any feature extraction. The input data consist of 64x64 pixel ugriz images centered on the spectroscopic targets, plus the galactic reddening value on the line-of-sight. For training sets of 100k objects or more (\${\textbackslash}geq\$ 20\% of the database), we reach a dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{MAD\}\${\textless}0.01, significantly lower than the current best one obtained from another machine learning technique on the same sample. The bias is lower than 0.0001, independent of photometric redshift. The PDFs are shown to have very good predictive power. We also find that the CNN redshifts are unbiased with respect to galaxy inclination, and that \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{MAD\}\$ decreases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), achieving values below 0.007 for SNR {\textgreater}100, as in the deep stacked region of Stripe 82. We argue that for most galaxies the precision is limited by the SNR of SDSS images rather than by the method. The success of this experiment at low redshift opens promising perspectives for upcoming surveys.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method to estimate the photometric redshift of galaxies by using the full galaxy image in each measured band. This method draws from the latest techniques and advances in machine learning, in particular Deep Neural Networks. We pass the entire multi-band galaxy image into the machine learning architecture to obtain a redshift estimate that is competitive, in terms of the measured point prediction metrics, with the best existing standard machine learning techniques. The standard techniques estimate redshifts using post-processed features, such as magnitudes and colours, which are extracted from the galaxy images and are deemed to be salient by the user. This new method removes the user from the photometric redshift estimation pipeline. However we do note that Deep Neural Networks require many orders of magnitude more computing resources than standard machine learning architectures, and as such are only tractable for making predictions on datasets of size ≤50k before implementing parallelisation techniques.},

	abstract = {Since more than 70 years ago, the colours of galaxies derived from flux measurements at different wavelengths have been used to estimate their cosmological distances. Such distance measurements, called photometric redshifts, are necessary for many scientific projects, ranging from investigations of the formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei to precision cosmology. The primary benefit of photometric redshifts is that distance estimates can be obtained relatively cheaply for all sources detected in photometric images. The drawback is that these cheap estimates have low precision compared with resource-expensive spectroscopic ones. The methodology for estimating redshifts has been through several revolutions in recent decades, triggered by increasingly stringent requirements on the photometric redshift accuracy. Here, we review the various techniques for obtaining photometric redshifts, from template-fitting to machine learning and hybrid schemes. We also describe state-of-the-art results on current extragalactic samples and explain how survey strategy choices affect redshift accuracy. We close with a description of the photometric redshift efforts planned for upcoming wide-field surveys, which will collect data on billions of galaxies, aiming to investigate, among other matters, the stellar mass assembly and the nature of dark energy.},
